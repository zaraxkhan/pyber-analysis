# PyBer-Analysis
In this analysis, I will be using Python inside of Jupyer Notebook to create dataframes and graphs with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Overview of Analysis
PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, needs help in improving access to ride-sharing services and determining affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This project with the company will share how their ride-sharing data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer. The CEO of PyBer would like some visualization of the total weekly fares per city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. This analysis will take place for the first four months of 2019, from January 1st to April 29th.  

## Results
From the analysis, these key metrics highlighted some disparities among the different city types.
### Figure 1: PyBer Summary based on City Type

From this table, we can see that the Urban cities request the largest share of rides and account for the highest number of drivers. Due to this , the average fare per ride is the lowest at $24.53 and accounts for the most profitablity at $39.854.38 in 4 months. The Rural cities bring in the least amount of profit at only $4,327.93 within 4 months. That is averaging only around $1,000 per month. Not only are the Rural cities making the lowest amount of profits, however, the drivers are seen being the most profitable from their rides; significantly higher than their Urban driver counterparts. Rural city passengers also pay the highest amount, however this makes sense as the distance they travel is most-likely greater than those in Urban cities.  Furthermore, this table shows that the demand for rides is greater in Rurual and Suburban cities than the amount of drivers. The opposite is seen for Urban cities; they have far too many drivers compared to the amount of asked rides. 

Below is a line graph to help better visualize the total fare per city type at a weekly basis.

This line graph clearly pictures the weekly fare earnings by city type. The Urban cities, just as stated previously when looking at the chart, makes the greatest amount of money compared to Suburban and Rural cities. Besides a few weeks, it seems as though each city type follows its own trend . There is more profit spikes in Urban cities that aren't seen for Rural cities. 

## Summary
From these results, we can see that Urban cities are the focus for earnings. Rural cities are barely bringing in $500 weekly for the company however, are the most profitable places for the drivers. We can also see from the chart that there way more drivers than riders in Urban cities that need to be taken care of. Below are some recommendations regarding this data set. 

### Recommendations
- Performing some market research in the Rural cities can help us realize how long each driver takes with their riders. This will help display the wait time for rural cities which may be the reason that there are not as many total rides completed.   
- Increase the cost of rides for the Urban market by a few dollars. It does not have to be as high as the Rural cities, as that spike would cause passangers to be angry, however the demand is there in Urban cities, so increasing the cost by a little could pay back huge dividends. 
- Reducing the amount of drivers in Urban cities and allocating them to Suburban and Rural cities. This way the supply meets the demand. By doing this, it may even encourage more Rural and Suburban folks to catch a ride with this app as persumably the wait time for a ride would decrease.
