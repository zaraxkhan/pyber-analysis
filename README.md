# PyBer-Analysis
In this analysis, I will be using Python inside of Jupyer Notebook to create dataframes and graphs with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Overview of Analysis
PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, needs help in improving access to ride-sharing services and determining affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This project with the company will share how their ride-sharing data differs by city type and how these differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer. The CEO of PyBer would like some visualization of the total weekly fares per city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. This analysis will take place for the first four months of 2019, from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019.  

## Results
From the analysis, these key metrics highlighted some disparities amoung the different city types.

From this table, we can see that the Urban cities request the largest share of rides and account for the highest number of drivers. Due to this , the average fare per ride is the lowest at $24.53 and accounts for the most profitablity at $39.854.38 in 4 months. The Rural cities bring in the least amount of profit at only $4,327.93 in 4 months. That is averaging only around $1,000 per month. Not only are the Rural cities making the lowest amount of profits, the drivers are being paid the highest amount; significantly higher than their Urban driver counterparts. Rural city passengers also pay the highest amount, however this makes sense as the distance they travel is most-likely greater than those in Urban cities. 

Below is a line graph to help better visualize the total fare per city type at a weekly basis.

This line graph . There is more profit spikes in Urban cities that aren't seen for Rural cities. 

## Summary

### Recommendations
- Performing some market research in the Rural cities can help confirm if there is much demand in this market segment to be investing in more dirvers in the area.
